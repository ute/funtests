Description: Nonparametric testing and visualization of data consisting of 
    vectors or arrays of independent (x-) and a dependent (y-) variable, such as functional
    data, time series or multivariate data (in the latter case, x is just an index).
    The independent variable may be multidimensional, but plotting is currently 
    only possible for onedimensional x (time  series, functions of one variable).  
    Comparison of group means of the 
    y-variable by a permutation test using a  studentized statistic that 
    can be considered a simplified version of Hotelling's T-squared test 
    for two groups (currently, the number of groups is limited to two).
