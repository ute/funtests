Description: Nonparametric testing and visualization of samples consisting of 
    vectors or arrays of observations x(t) taken at the same given measurement 
    points t, such as functional data, time series or multivariate data 
    (in the latter case, t is just an index).
    The independent variable may be multidimensional, but plotting is currently 
    only possible for onedimensional arguments t (time series, functions of one 
    variable).  
    Comparison of group means of the data by a permutation tests (currently, 
    the number of groups is limited to two). 
    Pointwise rank based tests for goodness of fit.
