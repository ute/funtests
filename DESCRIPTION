Description: Nonparametric testing and visualization of samples consisting of 
    vectors or arrays of observations x(t) taken at the same given measurement points t, 
    such as functional  data, time series or multivariate data 
    (in the latter case, t is just an index).
    The independent variable may be multidimensional, but plotting is currently 
    only possible for onedimensional arguments t (time series, functions of one variable).  
    Comparison of group means of the 
    data by a permutation test using a  studentized statistic that 
    can be considered a simplified version of Hotelling's T-squared test 
    for two groups (currently, the number of groups is limited to two).
